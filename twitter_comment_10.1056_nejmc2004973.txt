Aerosolized viruses can remain in the air for hours.  If we’re distancing properly, you minimize your exposure to droplets exhaled when we speak, cough, laugh, whatever. 

Masks help, but are not infallible.

Virus ini bisa tahan sampe 72 jam di permukaan plastik, stainless steel, karton, dan tembaga. Doi paling tahan di plastik, sedangkan di tembaga, ketahanannya
第61条=>@kulmayu @chrismartenson Awesome. The virus less stable on copper than plastic. If you strip the plastic insulation off the wire, chances of contamination might go down.
